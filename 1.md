### What is functional programming

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming), "Functional programming is a programming paradigm, a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs, that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data."

This is kind of a wordy explination, and digging deeper, I have found it doesnt get better. This is mostly because the origins of functional programming has roots in mathematics. To understand why functional programming in special requires us to talk about data and behavior and their relationship. 

### Data and Behavior

Generally programs are made up of 2 main components, data - the things a program knows and behavior - the things a program can do. In object oriented programming, the focus is to bind the data and behavior together into an entity called an object. Whereas in functional programming the focus is to keep data and behavior distinct and separate.

Here is an example of data and behavior being bound together.

``` javascript
// Object Oriented

class Animal {
    constructor(type, name, noise){
        this.type = type
        this.name = name
        this.noise = noise
    }
    greeting(){
        return `${this.noise}! ${this.name} the ${this.type} greets you.`
    }
}

const bessy = new Animal("Cow", "Bessy", "Mooooo")

console.log(bessy.greeting()) // "Mooooo! Bessy the Cow greets you."
```

An equivalent functional example may look something like this

``` javascript
// Functional

function animalGreeting(noise, name, type){
        return `${noise}! ${name} the ${type} greets you.`
    }

console.log(animalGreeting("Moooo", "Bessy", "Cow"))

```

Just looking at these examples, it does look like the functional way is simpler and more concise.

On the other hand, the organization of the object oriented way to appear to be more domain based and understandable.

Lets talk more about the rules of functional programming

### Important Terms

There are a few things we should define before we go too much further. This will set the stage for understanding what functional programming is in a more technical sense.

* *Mutations* - The changing of a variable after it has been declared.
```javascript
let arr = []
arr.push('a value') // mutation
```

* *Side Effect* - The changing of a variable that was declared outside the scope of the function that is accessing it.

```javascript
let arr = []

const changeArrAndGetLength = (item) => {
    arr.push(item)
    return arr.length
}

changeArrAndGetLength("another value")
```

* *Pure Function* - a function that does not have side effects. Creating pure functions requires the use of parameters and return values to get data into and out of a function.

```javascript
const imAPureFunction = (name) => {
    return "Hello, " + name
}
```
* *Higher-Order Functions* - a function that takes a function as a parameter, or returns a function.
```javascript
const addTwoNumbers = (firstNumber) => {
    return (secondNumber) => { // returns a function
        return firstNumber + secondNumber
    }
}

const result = addTwoNumbers(5)(6) // 11
```


### The Rules

Before we get into the rules, I want to highlight the goal of my writing. It is not to persuade anyone to be strictly functional programmers. My goal is more to education others in the strengths of functional programming to enhance your tool-set and to help you write more high quality, maintainable software. with that said, lets thing of these 'rules' more as guidelines. 

1. No mutations
2. No `for` or `while` loops - the use of these control structures implies mutations are occurring.
3. Use *only* pure functions
